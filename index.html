          <strong>1.SW1-Safety of school going kids </strong> Every now and then we hear about cases of young kids being kidnapped while commuting to and from school. This is a very serious problem that must be tackled. Since it is not suitable for
          young children to carry mobile phones, some other device or system must be developed for tracking and ensuring the safety of kids.
          Expected Deliverables:Design and develop an equipment/software for ensuring the safety of school kids travelling alone, with provision for SOS call.
          <br>
          <strong>2.SW2-Application for hearing and speech impaired people</strong>The life of a person who has both hearing and speech disability is very difficult. They cannot interact with everyone. Lip-reading is very difficult in come cases and
          sign language cannot be understood by most people. There should be a system that performs instantaneous text-to speech and speech-to-text conversion for making their lives easier.
          Expected Deliverables: Design and develop an equipment/software for making communication easier for hearing and speech impaired people.
          <br>
          <strong>3.SW3-Pollution level analysis</strong>.Pollution is the new major environmental problem nowadays. With the increase in the number of respiratory diseases cases, people are becoming more conscious and aware about pollution as a
          major problem in today’s world. People generally avoid high pollution areas, or go there with proper precaution. However it would be much easier if there was a system that would determine the pollution level in their area (similar to live
          location based weather systems).
          Expected Deliverables: Design and develop an equipment/software for measuring the pollution level in the area near the user’s location.

            <p><b>FOR1</b> A website wants to track activity/sessions of its users and stores all that info in a Nosql database and there’re lakhs of such records. And there’s some other portion of user info that’s present in a different storage
              system (say an RDBMS database (that too single threaded and not a client server system) with much slower access rate in comparison to the one keeping the above dynamic data), and there are parts of the dashboard that fetch this info in
              conjunction with the dynamic data. Suppose that there’s a dashboard for administrators that shows a snapshot of the number of users, nature of activity (say watching certain shows available on the website, catching up some newsfeeds,
              etc)etc, whose monitoring is crucial per the business model. How would you ensure accesses to persistent data doesn’t become a bottleneck and slow up the activities on the dashboard. How would work you around the challenge posed by the
              database/storage system where certain ports of user info is kept and accessed as much as the other dynamic info present in the Nosql database</p>
            <p><b>FOR2</b> Tracking a suspicious system activity.</p>
            <p>a. We make a list few system resources, if user or any application tries to access or modify these resources, then alert the system admin via email.</p>
            <p>b. Admin should get notification for each user login.</p>
            <p>c. If too many failed log-in attempt from a particular client, inform the admin.</p>
            <p><b>FOR3</b> String search problem: Design an algorithm to find a substring in a string in an efficient way, and compare it with Knuth Morris Pratt pattern matching algorithm. Develop the algorithm in C or C++ and test it with multiple
              samples of data</p>
            <p><b>FOR4</b> Design an algorithm to enable an efficient file transfer to multiple clients, using only single file descriptor to access the file in the file system. Runtime memory usage should not cross file size.</p>
            <p><b>FOR5</b> String search problem: Design an algorithm to find a substring in a string in an efficient way, and compare it with Knuth Morris Pratt pattern matching algorithm. Develop the algorithm in C or C++ and test it with multiple
              samples of data.</p>
            <p><b>FOR6</b> Design and Develop an CPU and memory efficient stub for redis database, to achieve relational database functionality. Take sample table, of one lakh entries, with five fields and querable by any of the field values. The
              program should output the CPU and memory used used for each query. Efficiency of memory used should be output periodically, like memory fragmentation stats etc.</p>
            <p><b>FOR7</b> Given a graph of access points(AP’s), nodes of graph representing AP’s and edges (undirected) between them representing ranges.</p>
            <p>i.e. if two AP say AP1 and AP2 has edge between them meaning they are in range of each other.</p>
            <p>We have to find minimum number of non-overlapping channels which we can assign to them.</p>
            <p>Eg:</p>
            <p>AP1--------------------------------------AP2-------------------AP3</p>
            <p>Solution: Min 2 channels is required here.</p>
            <p>Solution to above problem is a perfect example of graph colouring problem.</p>
            <p>To solve it people have to find minimum number of colours which they can use to colour the graph so that no adjacent nodes have same colour.</p>
            <p>Difficulty: Hard, this problem is NP-Hard, we have to go by heuristics to solve it.</p>

            <li><b>IA1-Methods to deal with hazardous gases and possible leaks</b>:Many industries deal with various hazardous gas. There is immense danger to all the workers if there happens to be a leakage. So it's very important to provide
              security to those employees working within these industries. If leakage of gas takes place then we need a system to provide alerts by turning ON an alarm which notifies the employers.<p></p>
              <p><b>Expected Deliverables</b>: System to alert employees in case of a hazardous gas leak and identify the area of the leak.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>IA2- Atrocious lives of the traffic police</b>: Nowadays the pollution in most of the metropolitan cities has hit unacceptable levels. Combining that with the increasing vehicular traffic, the life of traffic police has become a
              daylight atrocity with most being affected by the dust and pollution.<p></p>
              <p><b>Expected Deliverables</b>: A suitable system to tackle the problems listed above as well as be economical.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>IA3-Damage Identification to belts or machinery</b>: The constant use of heavy raw materials and equipment in industries causes the formation of cracks on industrial belts or even damage to the machinery.<p><b>Expected
                  Deliverables</b>: A system to identify the points of cracks on the industrial belt. Further, even damage to machinery must be identified.</p>

            <p>1.<b>HC1-VR in Exposure Therapy and Treatment of anxiety disorders with VR.</b>VR in Exposure Therapy and Treatment of Anxiety Disorders With VR as a deeply immersive and visual medium, it's not surprising to find its use in exposure
              therapy. Interactive VR platform in use at university centers, military bases, and veterans hospitals can offers patients virtual environments that mirror their traumatic experiences. A trained therapist controls the emotional stimuli
              and monitors their stress responses. Patient Recovery and Wellness using VR Many of these applications will benefit from the ongoing research in biofeedback monitoring. A highly innovative VR platform to map and respond to brain
              activity for applications in healthcare. VR is exploring ways to expand the effectiveness of using VR in therapy. A rehabilitation software motivates patients to perform specific movements, using games, movies, and 360 degrees
              interactive guides. What makes these applications incredibly valuable is the precise analytics they collect that can lead to further customization of patient care.</p>
            <p>2.<b>HC2-Diagnosis of Facial dysmorphic features using ML</b>Diagnosis of facial dysmorphic features (ML) Facial recognition software is being combined with machine learning to help clinicians diagnose rare diseases (in this case, from
              facial dysmorphic features). Patient photos are analyzed using facial analysis and deep learning to detect phenotypes that correlate with rare genetic diseases.</p>
            <p>3.<b>HC3-Lack of access to quality clinical care close to the patient’s homes is the major cause for medical problems being detected late and having bad clinical outcomes. This is true for maternal care as well</b>.In Primary Health
              Centres (PHCs) across India, clinical personnel are often ill equipped from a skill perspective to carry out timely interventions for expectant mothers. The doctors in a PHC follow an elementary checklist while treating pregnant women.
              Firstly, these checklists do not adhere to the standard recommendations of National Rural Health Mission(NRHM) or the World Health Organization(WHO) and hence medical conditions like risk of anaemia, Post-Partum Haemorrhage etc. are not
              detected early. Secondly, the doctors in PHCs only provide “minimal treatment” and refer most of the cases directly to the General Hospital. This causes even the most routine cases to be forwarded to the General/District hospitals
              instead of being handled in the PHC. Congestion in General/District hospitals due to this practice leads to their bandwidth not being available for critical cases. This project aims to provide a standardized care protocol that can
              self-enhance and learn contextually as doctors in PHCs use it.</p>

            <li><b>RT1-Design a management system for effective distribution of water resources in rural areas based on the use</b>One of the major problems in rural areas is the effective distribution of water resources. While things such as
              agriculture need more water and regular lifestyle of people consume less water, distribution of water is not very proper in villages generally.<p><b>Expected Deliverables</b>: You are expected to come up with an effective management

              them and even after reporting such instances the proper action lacks. In some scenarios, nearby people can be of a great help.<p><b>Expected Deliverables</b>: You need to come up with an app which allows instant reporting and quick
                notifying the nearby people who can come to the scene and help. This should be simultaneously reported to the police station so that the police can reach the scene as soon as possible.</p>

              the wholesalers in the market and do not get the deserved money as the intermediate sellers take a lot of the profit.<p><b>Expected Deliverables</b>: You need to design a platform where the farmers can go and sell their yield directly
                to the consumer who can receive the product at a much lower price as compared to market price as the intermediate commission is nullified.</p>
